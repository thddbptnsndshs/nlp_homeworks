Without undermining the talents of the orchestra accompanying them, 'OK Human' gives us four extremely capable musicians in their element. Jake Sinclair also deserves a mention, who not only guided the direction of this project but also the band's 2016 'White Album'.

There are also quirky references throughout the album. From \u201cgetting back to his Zoom Interviews\u201d in Playing My Piano to \u201ceveryone staring at their screens and everyone moving to the cloud\u201d in the song Screen is a tragic truth of how humans are not genuinely communicating in this modern age of technology. This album also features heartfelt empathic songs like Numbers and Bird With A Broken Wing. The former explores the sadness in how human measures its success and happiness while the latter is Cuomo's way of summing up his journey and telling everyone to do not feel sorry about him since he is okay despite his broken wings is like a juxtaposition to the band's 25-year career. That song is so deep and touching. The theme of sadness continues in Dead Roses until we hear Cuomo being triumphant in a more upbeat track, Here Comes the Rain. The band ultimately wrapped up the album with the hopeful song LaBrea Tar Pits which mirrors our daily struggles and optimism to get out of it.\r No matter what other people suggest, OK Human is a beautiful pop album, exploring the simple themes of day-to-day existence, isolation, and the impact of technology in our lives in the modern age that is so catchy and relatable.

We get it, you\u2019re an artist. Experiment and do your thing but break us off with something we want to. One for you, one for us? Van Weezer was supposed to be out first and I get that they wanted to save it for when they can tour again. That said, this is 3 albums straight devoid of riffs and that rock sound that got you in the door. What a tease! Maybe I just have to adjust expectations after being stoked for a return to those crunchy guitars that defined the band in the 90\u2019s and that they returned to triumphantly with \u201cEverything Will Be Alright In The End\u201d and the even better \u201cWhite Album\u201d. It was a return to form with a modern twist, seemingly pleasing us longtime fans while giving Rivers and Co a chance to explore. Anyway, Im spinning this new recor.... spotifly album a second time and it grows on you. I\u2019m a sucker for catchy pop so Rivers will always steal my money and have my loyalty even if I can\u2019t play the music around my alternative rock snob wife.

The songs effectively bounce from noticeable bits of McCartney-inspired piano and vocal licks to soaring Beach Boys harmonies, and even brief shades of Randy Newman, while retaining Cuomo\u2019s signature knack for ear-worm melodic choruses and reminding you at every turn this is still the group who wrote Buddy Holly. Highlights include Bird With A Broken Wing and Numbers, both tracks flex Cuomo\u2019s often under appreciated (or unnoticed) talent as a truly great American songwriter, that recently we only see rare glimpses of, but he reaches corners and stretches to areas we have suspected but never knew he was truly capable of.The soaring, catchy, yet emotionally melancholic chorus of Bird With A Broken Wing is the absolute best of classic Weezer in every way, but manages to sound vibrant, new and refreshing due to due the serious, poetic subject matter, Jake Sinclair\u2019s sleek production, and new orchestral arrangement with the band. Change the arrangement on this track in the right ways and you could squeeze it into a 90s weezer catalogue and it would hold its own as a classic. However, where the band and Cuomo truly break new ground as an act is with his ability in both tracks to create earnest, heart-wrenching break downs during the bridge. \u201cNothing matter\u2019s in the world, and everyone is free. But I\u2019ll belong to you if you believe in me.\u201d Cuomo admits in the emotional release of the song, as the orchestra fades out. He\u2019s written arguably perfect, emotional bridges in the past, but none in this sort of context where he proves he can make moving, well-crafted songs that stand on their own without the all the bells and whistles that come along with chugging electric guitars and modern music production. This album isn\u2019t going to define the decade or probably even the year, but art needs to be examined in context. Weezer have set out to do something they\u2019ve never done before, that many would say they\u2019re incapable of, and not only succeeded at it but proven they\u2019re quite good at it, and I don\u2019t see how this record could\u2019ve come out better.

For a couple of them it restored their faith that modern Weezer can still put a great album together. The commentary we had going about the album was so much fun! It was awesome to just sit and listen together. Each track seamlessly led into the next, and each track brought with it so many cool surprises. The album is incredibly well produced and keeps bringing me back for listen after listen. I'm trying not to wear it out, but it doesn't seem to be losing it's flavor for me. This album is rich with nuance and varried instrumentation. Everything from Rivers' songwriting to the rest of the band's contributions are all spot on. Brian's backing vocals are fantastic, but I wish they were brought up a little higher in the mix. I'm not sure if Scott had any backing vocal contribution, but his bass playing was great as usual. Pat's drumming was off the charts! They achieved such a great, crisp, punchy drum sound on this record.*AMFS - 8\/10 I like the song a lot, but it's one of the weaker tracks. It's a great intro into the album.*Aloo Gobi - 9\/10 such a fun song! Fantastic bridge. One of the more nuanced songs instramentally. That bridge!*Grapes of Wrath - 9\/10 What a groovy tune. If the album had another single this would have to be it. These track transitions and sequencing are the best on any Weezer album, period.*Numbers - 10\/10 One of the best songs Rivers has ever penned. I get teary every time I listen to this track. The bridge is absolutely brilliance! \"I'm a 1 I'm a 0, in the end does it matter?...But the numbers don't compute, when we love and the 2 becomes 1.\" Are you freaking kidding me Rivers? Damn!*Playing My Piano - 9\/10 \"I just can't let gooooooo\" I love this track. Rivers' vocals are top notch (as it is on the entire album), and once again the bridge is fantastic!*Mirror Image - 10\/10 Short, sweet, and to the point. This song makes for a great interlude and bridges the two halves of the album nicely. Pat's drumming and the backing vocals really shine on this track.*Screens - 7\/10 Though this is the weakest of the tracks, I still really like it. That thumping beat perfectly kicks off the 2nd half of the album. Weakest lyrics on the album, but nothing bad here. I love the horns on this track. Love the outro, \"I miss my friends! I miss my family!\"*Bird With a Broken Wing - 10\/10 This is what I feel to be one of the most honest and personal tracks on the album. Lyrically and musically beautiful. That chorus! That bridge! I can't even begin to express how grateful I am that Rivers is writing his age. Please please keep this up!*Dead Roses - 10\/10 Like an intro to a great Bond movie, this upbeat yet minor and tragic track keep the momentum and mood going strong to begin winding up the album. These are among Rivers' most poetic and Gothic lyrics he's ever written. Bravo! Keep writing songs like this.*Everything Happens For a Reason - 8\/10 Probably should have just been added to the intro of HCTR. I like it. It's nice.*Here Comes The Rain - 8\/10 This song is a ton of fun! It brings a needed lighthearted lift to the more dramatic previous few tracks. Another outstanding bridge here and great vocal delivery. I love the little vocal nuances Rivers delivers throughout this whole album.*La Brea Tar Pits - 10\/10 Not the closer I was expecting, but that's what I love about it. Extremely interesting musically, and closes the album out perfectly thematically. This track has been discussed heavily on the boards, so I don't have a lot more to add, but I love it! A perfect closer to an album I consider to be a masterpiece.I am so so happy and grateful to have a Weezer album of this caliber in 2021. I would have never guessed that they could reach or exceed what they achieved with White, but they did! God bless you Rivers, Pat, Scott, and Jake Sinclair for so artfully and meticulously creating this album. It is easily the best sequenced Weezer album ever and certainly holds its own as a Weezer classic. I've never had an emotional connection quite as strong as I do to this album. It resonates with me right now in my life more than any other Weezer album has been able to.

High as a Kite is the standout song but it deserves to be on a better album and further highlights how bad most of the other tracks are. Even the glossy production can't mask the stench of these soulless turds, in fact it makes them extra offensive. Weezer are smart though, they know the money is in touring, merch, memes, gimmicks and the occasional radio hit. I credit Weezer for their continued appeal and popularity but I don't consider them a legit band anymore, just a novelty act with little artistic integrity. They're just going through the motions now, the other three guys are just puppets happy to go along with Rivers' latest wacky musical tangent and pick up a paycheck. They're very poor live too. It's a shame because they still have a little talent. For example they worked with a decent producer on White and put out a cohesive band-centric album that played to their strengths and will hold up in the future. But then Rivers goes and slaps you in the face, and not for the first time. He seems to be in a perpetual state of confusion about what kinda band he wants Weezer to be, as well as his own songwriting skills and musical direction. He also now often works with outside songwriters. Let's take the co-writer of Zombie Bastards as an example. Here are some of the other acts he's worked with: Britney Spears, Nicki Minaj, Madonna, Backstreet Boys, Demi Lovato,  One Direction, Westlife, The Saturdays, P!nk, Celine Dion, Enrique Iglesias, Ti\u00ebsto, Avicii and NSYNC. And somehow this band still gets featured in Kerrang magazine?!

This record is one of halves, and the front half, if nothing special, is at least listenable and enjoyable enough. \"Can't Knock the Hustle\" and \"Living in LA\", with their funky dance beats and prickly guitar riffs, lay the groundwork for the urban rhythms Rivers Cuomo expressed interest in exploring in the lead-up to release, while \"High as a Kite\" lulls you with mellow dream-pop before blasting it all away in an explosion of guitar and synths, a clashing of personalities that recalls and highlights the influence of bands like the Pixies. \"I'm Just Being Honest\", another perfectly danceable pop song that's probably among their best within the last few years, sounds like it could have been a hilarious spin on All-American Rejects-style pop punk with more distortion guitar, and though \"Piece of Cake\" is wholly bland and \"Zombie Bastards\" (some interesting lyrical flourishes aside) repeats many of the mistakes made with \"Feels Like Summer\", they work well enough in the moment that you might be willing to give them another spin.\r Whereas the first half was, if admittedly a little scattershot, fairly consistent in terms of tone, themes and quality, however, the second spirals out of control and nearly drags the entire record down with it. \"Too Many Thoughts in My Head\" is too sonically and lyrically jarring to revisit again after the first listen, as if Rivers had thrown caution to the wind and created the strangest song he could think of, and while the injection of a little more guitar into \"The Prince Who Wanted Everything\" is certainly welcome, it's in service of a song so dull that it does little to liven up the affair (also, the only band who can talk about how rock-and-roll their music is in their own songs and manage to sound only slightly ridiculous is AC\/DC, so let's just leave that to them). If not for the fact that it were by Weezer (and even this might not save it from that fate), \"Byzantine\" is so mind-numbingly generic and bland that it could easily be mistakable for easy-listening or elevator music, and the electro-soundscape where the boys get themselves lost in \"California Snow\" is about as far removed from Weezer as anyone could imagine, much less want.\r Weezer has shown us before that they can surprise us with a comeback album so great that it makes you forget about what all had come before to tarnish their reputation in the first place. Who knows? Maybe they've got one tucked away somewhere that will wipe away the wasted potential that was this record. Seeing as it seemed that they were just starting to get their groove back, however, it'd probably be best to release that sooner rather than later. 5\/10\r Choice Cuts: \"High as a Kite\", \"Living in LA\", \"I'm Just Being Honest\"\u2026 Expand","125":"While this album is a mixed bag of songs, there are still some classic catchy songs that grab my attention.

I'd say as bad as it gets, but I cannot underestimate Cuomo enough it seems.

A few publications gave it 3\/5 so they could keep Weezer in their good graces but for real, who is this for?  A casual Spotify listener?  Hoping to get their songs in as many playlists as possible?  I can't rationalize the decisions other than Cuomo seems desperate to stay relevant and he's going down the same road every other rock band is going down.  Have you noticed that?  Pick any band that was popular between 1995 and 2005, ask yourself if they're still together, and then listen to their most recent release.  It's probably going to go down this same road.  I could go on for way longer but I'm already just ranting at this point.  Rivers has written some of my favorite music of all time and I am just forever disappointed in seeing how low he will go.  This is the first album of theirs (outside of DTFM) that I cannot defend at all.  I fear the Black Album will be just as bad, if not worse.

I mean it's not really the direction I wanted from the band, but at the same time this is nowhere as awful as Make Believe or Raditude! And at least they aren't trying to awkwardly mix trap beats into their sound (coughTaylorSwiftcough). This is a pop album, but not in what pop sounds like. It's another California album that is deeply indeded in Beach Boys worship. Which is not a bad sound to copy at all. There's an eclectic sense of instrumentation and composition here that does, to a degree, work with the slick production here. However, there isn't anything as exciting or powerful here, which sucks coming from a POWER POP band. It all just feels weak and limp and held back from being memorable or bombastic, which is certainly what I want from a Weezer album! However there are times this more relaxed sound does work. Happy Hour and Weekend Woman do work because they have some pretty catchy hooks and River's vocals, which definitely have aged and at times do not sound good (looking at you QB Blitz), are pretty decent. But other times, like lead off single Feels Like Summer, where the pop sound just falls flat on it's face. I didn't hate this album, but I didn't really feel anything from it either. I'll give it more credit than most fans because I kind of get where the band was coming from and there are plenty of great ideas and even tunes here. It's just an underwhelming album really. I doubt this is the direction Weezer will take with this album and will probably go back to their trademark 90s alt-rock meets power pop sound, and it does not have ANY low points from clunkers like Raditude (I.E. the **** Lil Wayne song!), but this does not come close to their best, unfortunately.\u2026 Expand","199":"This is overall a solid attempt at a chill, pop-rock album.

I love Mexican Fender, and Beach Boys was smooth but the overt reference to the Beach Boys just seemed a little to much.  Happy Hour was meh as well, but i could hear a consistent sound coming out of the album, all the songs seemed to fit well, then I heard Weekend Woman - really liked it a lot, so it was 2 our of 5, and then I heard the rest of the album:\r QB Blitz and and Sweet Mary were both fantastic and catchy (QB Blitz has this fantastic bridge somewhere near the 2 minute mark) - Weezer still seems to have a mixed bag when it comes to lyrics - most of the time the lyrics are meh, but at least these were mixed with some music I really liked.  I was also hearing songs I'd never heard in a Weezer song before, and it wasn't bothering me; I was enjoying it.\r I was starting to notice, I could still hear typical Weezer underneath the very different sounding production (different for Weezer) - I was hearing a bit of Make Believe power chords and singing style, but.. the production gloss on Pacific Daydream just sounded better with this style.\r Get Right and La Mancha Screwjob were not quite as strong as the songs immediately preceding it, but still better to listen to than Feels like Summer...\r The final song on the album, Any Friend of Diane's, I love this one, found myself humming along to it.  The lyrics again.. not the most memorable, but I still love listening to it.\r I like the album length, the number of songs, it's easier to compare to other weezer albums.  I definitely liked this one a lot more than Raditude, Hurley, Make Beiieve, and Red Album... this album is just more consistent.  I could imagine some of these songs sounding great with a little more of the usual Weezer guitar crunch and a solo or two, but these were still genuinely good.\r So, some of this album is a bit dull, but it's nice to have this little gem in the Weezer repertoire.  I think it's somewhat underrated based on reviews I've seen so far.   I give is a solid 7.  It's like a Sloan album...  mediocre, but consistently so, with a couple songs that are mediocre++ to great!!   at least 6 out of 10 of these songs I want to listen to over and over.  And the remaining 4 are tolerable.   This is similar to White album for me..  6 out of 10 great songs, with 4 that are tolerable, although White album might have an edge [on Pacific Daydream] because I think some of the good songs are much better than the good songs on Pacific Daydream.\u2026 Expand","215":"\u201cWe belong in the rock world,\u201d Rivers Cuomo opined on Weezer\u2019s late-career gem Everything Will Be Alright in the End, and many of us would very much agree.

Their Raditude days are probably best forgotten, which is why some of you out there in the Weezerverse no doubt balked at the distinctly pop production present on Pacific Daydream. For these people this step backward may be unforgivable, especially after their apology for their previous foray into the genre, but for the rest of us Cuomo and Co. have delivered a catchy and fun (if unremarkable) collection of summertime tunes.\r Let me say right now that Daydream is no Raditude. Yes, Butch Walker reappears in the production credits, and no, the album is by no means a masterpiece like Pinkerton or even on the same level as the band\u2019s last love letter to the summertime season, but despite its flaws (of which there are many) I found it oddly endearing. The tunes are catchier, punchier, and more tightly crafted than those on Raditude, with just enough guitar to maintain a \u201cpop-rock\u201d label and oddball pop culture references to satisfy fans who can\u2019t wait for the fabled Black Album to get their Weezer fix.\r I mentioned flaws earlier. Let\u2019s talk about those. The wit and sheer cheerful energy that the sun-soaked banger \u201cMexican Fender\u201d kicks off the record with is only sporadically seen again, and a feeling is given off while listening that the band couldn\u2019t come to a consensus in regard to the big idea on Pacific Daydream, causing the record to come off a little tonally constipated. Had a better balance been struck between the carefree day and the more self-serious night (perhaps a re-ordering of songs might have helped this) we could have seen an interesting progression through a single summer day, but the latter more often overwhelms the former and the resultant melancholy moping that abounds is shockingly reminiscent of The Chainsmokers\u2019 melodramatic drivel. Further strengthening the comparison to everyone\u2019s favorite talentless EDM duo is the fact that on several songs Cuomo\u2019s songwriting and singing seem particularly weak \u2013 on \u201cHappy Hour\u201d he gratingly holds a single note for most of the first verse, and his shoutouts to Stevie Ray Vaughan and Monty Python feel forced and out of place \u2013 and eager to take advantage of the current trend towards electronic (a la \u201cFeels Like Summer\u201d). In these instances, it\u2019s (surprisingly) more often Walker who salvages the song with beats that are catchy and fun even when the accompanying vocal delivery is crushingly dull. One final thing: who releases an album full of summer-ready songs just as it\u2019s starting to get cold? It\u2019s more than a little depressing to be reminded of sunny days on sandy shores with winter on its way.\r It should be noted that there\u2019s lots to like here as well. Regardless of your opinion on the record as a whole, many of you will likely find \u201cWeekend Woman\u201d, where roaring guitars that blast away twinkling pop flourishes recall ghosts of Weezer past, agreeable, and I\u2019ll be damned if \u201cMexican Fender\u201d doesn\u2019t pop up in a few playlists next summer (I\u2019ll tell you right now that it\u2019s already in mine). Other tunes like \u201cAny Friend of Diane\u2019s\u201d, \u201cLa Mancha Screwjob\u201d, and \u201cGet Right\u201d are nice little pop ditties that won\u2019t stick with you for long afterwards but go down smooth as a cold drink on a hot summer day when they\u2019re on, making them some primo background noise for a little fun under the sun. \u201cQB Blitz\u201d is one of the better-written songs on the album, showcasing a singer-songwriter aspect to Cuomo that we\u2019ve only occasionally seen before (\u201cButterfly\u201d on Pinkerton, \u201cEndless Bummer\u201d on the White Album, and a few others), and while more successful in some aspects than others the boys do show a willingness to experiment with their sound.\r In short, does this deserve to be remembered as one of the great albums among Weezer\u2019s catalogue? Not really. But it is a fun little diversion while we wait for something bigger and better from the boys, though hoping for another Pinkerton this late in their career might be expecting a little too much. But it\u2019s nice to dream, isn\u2019t it?

The instrumentation just sounds too overproduced and like it could have done by another mainstream pop artist. The album definitely has a consistent vibe, which I think is positive, but I ended up feeling a bit sickly by the end of the album; yearning for more guitars and more rock.\r There are tracks on here that are likeable - see 'Mexican Fender' & 'QB Blitz', that have a more atypical Weezer style; great melodies and quirky lyrics. 'Happy Hour' is an example of where their pop experiment works, some of the lyrics in it are suspect, but they work against the mellow, sunshine vibes of the song.\r This would have stood as a strong pop album were it not for a couple of big misfires, namely 'Feels Like Summer' & 'Beach Boys'. The former just feels too far from Weezer that even repeated listens haven't saved it, it just feels too commercialized and lacking in soul. The latter is catchy, it isn't a bad song per se, but the lyrics are some of the worst I've experienced, in any song, really.\r Overall, the album feels like an unnecessary experiment, but fair play to them for trying something with a different vibe. Some of it works, some of it hurts. We all know Rivers & the band can make top quality music but it depends on their focus. No one minds experimenting, but perhaps next time they should do it within the genre they are famed and loved for? Either that or... release the album under a different name?

The chorus gets old fast, and the same can be said of the song. \"Screwjob\" starts off with some cool music, but the rest of the song is pretty dull.

The album's final three tracks (L.A. Girlz, Jacked Up and Endless Bummer) solidify the album as one of the band's best. L.A. Girlz, a rock anthem to the girls of Los Angeles, is arguably one of the band's best songs, regardless of album. Jacked Up is an uplifting love song and Endless Bummer closes out the album by capturing the feelings of going back to school for younger listeners and reminiscing about a summer relationship perfectly.\rNot only is \"The White Album\" one of the best power pop albums of the year, it's one of the band's top 5 albums ever released.\u2026 Expand","253":"This is my third favorite album.

By the time of that albums release my expectations for a Weezer album were so drastically reduced that it was hard to know whether the band had actually made a good album or whether it simply just wasn't awful.

Boldly known as \"White\", weezer's 4th eponymous album is lean and toned. 10 tracks that come in at just over half an hour, every song is built around melodies rather than riffs.

That was one of the reasons why Rivers went into isolation shortly thereafter.  But I'm getting off point here.  What I'm trying to say is that this album has enough of a great blend of pop, power, reverb, nostalgia, and 2016 Weezer in it to keep Weezer fans and maybe more than a few newbies coming back for more. Give it a listen and I'm fairly certain you won't be disappointed.

It\u2019s these intense moments, shared similarly in the verses of \u201cL.A.

And yeah, there's several other great tracks on there, those two just really stand out to me. Granted, I was kind of let down by their 3 part finale. I expected it to be absolutely massive and out of this world and thematic and awesome, and it ended up just being mostly instrumental. It sounds fine, don't get me wrong, but I was expecting more.\rI was gonna give this an 8, but hell, I'm just so happy to hear a Weezer album that sounds like a Weezer album, so I gotta give it some extra love for that.

I was full-on face punched by nostalgia.","309":"A full album with no real dips in quality, a familiar sound with new and exciting ideas; EWBAITE is the kind of album the weezer of now should be making and I'm glad they finally did it.

It's one of the best post-Pinkerton albums they have made, right next to Maladroit. The album flows really well and has a consistent as the older albums did.

Awesome album!  And I have to agree,  probably best start to finish album since Pinkerton.","318":"This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \n1994 brought the Blue album. I was barely a month old when the album released. A couple years later brought Pinkerton, an album that was shunned by most reviewers at release. While I may be \"too young\" to understand Weezer's impact on music at time of release, I can tell you that I know as much as any other older fan knows about the band. With that said, I have NO problem saying that this is the best record the band has made since Pinkerton. I am able to find high points in every record released, but I am also able to point out the lowpoints. This record has NO lowpoints. Sure, Back to the Shack may not be the greatest song ever released, but when listened to with the rest of the album, it sounds great. \"Ain't Got Nobody\" is the perfect opener, giving casual l that isteners a taste of the old Weezer that we have all longed for, mixed with a new energy. \"Eulogy For A Rock Band\" seems to be a homage to older bands that don't know when to quit (insert Weezer is too old joke here; they're not). \"Lonely Girl\" is a must-listen to any die-hard \"Green\" album fans. \"I've Had It Up To Here\" is an amazing song from all aspects, on my first listen, the falsettos by Rivers had me star struck. He's hit high notes before, but this is completely new. \"The British Are Coming\" is a lyrically playful, yet well put together song. I feel as if this may be the best composed song of them all, instrumentally speaking. \"Da Vinci\" and \"Go Away\" are some of my favorites, and should definitely be played on the radio, as they appeal to pop \/ alt \/ rock genres, without crossing into one genre alone. \"Cleopatra\" is a very unique song, with changes in time signature that could confuse the listener immediately. With that said, the solo sounds very Iron Maiden-esque to me (just my interpretation). Now on to \"Foolish Father\". Wow. I see this song as the closer of the album, even though there are three songs that follow. Sure, the song may seem a little \"weird\" at times, but for any \"Blue\" \/ \"Pinkerton\" fan, this song closes doors that were opened long ago. True Weezer fans understand what the father figure plays in the classic \"Say It Ain't So\", and this song is a complete 180 from that. If you're someone who values lyrics as much, or more than the instrumentals themselves, I recommend really listening to this song. Next comes \"The Futurescope Trilogy\". This is an entrance to a dimension that Weezer has never explored before. Consisting of three songs (only one having lyrics), it answers the question \"can Rivers really shred?\". The answer is yes. Thats all I want to give away. Please, PLEASE, listen to this album with an open mind. It is definitely in the top three for me, and a lot of other fans.\u2026 Expand","319":"Personally I have loved all weezer albums. Each one was great in their own right.

Comparable to the Blue album and Pinkerton, while attempting to add some new directions and sound, Weezer's new album is sure to be ear candy for those alternative rocker die hard fans.\r Pros:\r1) CONSISTENT SOUND AND CATCHY STYLES:\rIt seems that this Album is not afraid to tackle different aspects of alternative rock, and it does a flawless job of capturing the different styles  of alternative rock and packs it into a single album. There is always a song on this album someone is GUARANTEED to love, even if they are no fans of alternative rock. From the quiet approach of \"The British are coming\" to the last minute guitar explosion of \"Return to Ithaka\" The album perfects a catchy hook for each song and makes sure that the hook doesn't lead to a dud song.\r 2) FLAWLESS SONGWRITING AND PRODUCTION\rAlong with all the aspects weezer shines at us with its new album, The lyrics seems to connect with the atmosphere of each song it's in. \"Cleopatra\" for example, shows the complications of life and how time will fly by and the experiences we will see as we grow old, while the music is not a \"Shove in your face\" atmosphere, but more of a storytelling atmosphere. In \"Back To The Shack\" The lyrics express Weezer's frustration with how the sounds of 1994 in music seem so far away, while the atmosphere attempts and scceeds at painting a nostalgic time warp back to 1994. Wanna go back in time? Hop into the warp!\r Cons:\rI couldn't find any major flaws with the album. It sounds consistent and catchy, which is all that its needed to make a great album\r Conclusion:\rThere is only one sentence that can sum up this Album.

But yet, the album isn't unoriginal and has it's own feel.  Rivers really shines here, his singing really gives off a mood for each song and his lead guitar work is exuberant.  Really, the whole bands instrumentation work is top notch.  Finally, Scott's bass work is able to praised.  And Patrick gives us a few good drum moments, a particular quirky moment on Da Vinci reminiscent of The Good Life.  The lyrics aren't something special, but they are the best Rivers has written since the Pinkerton days.  They are sincere, and emotional.  Ain't Got Nobody is a perfect album opener, full of chugging guitars and wonderful drum work.  Back to the Shack was a really great single, being catchy and fun.  Eulogy for a Rock Band is a track that needs to grow on you, it's pretty slow but the chorus is a highlight of the whole album.  Lonely Girl is reminiscent of The Green Album days, but it's mostly dull.  I've Had it Up to Here is so quirky and has a really great solo.  The British Are Coming has some excellent singing and lyrics.  The chorus is super catchy as well and the hook is super fun.  Da Vinci is similar to El Scorcho, found on Pinkerton but it lacks charm.  Go Away is a great collaboration.  The lyrics are top notch and Rivers and Bethany's voices pair up nicely.  Cleopatra is such a throwback to The Blue Album days, being super fun and catchy, using harmonicas and acoustic guitar strumming.  The song turns heavy and dark as it goes on.  The song is a highlight on the album.  Foolish Father is supposed to be very emotional, but it falls flat.  A very lackluster track.  The Futurescope Trilogy is full of great experimentation, full of intense guitar work and some great drumming by Pat.  A massive and great way to end this album.

I understood the apologetic element to the song referring to when the band went slightly off track in order to try and make Chart-Topping music with Raditude. However, Hurley was a quick- almost instinctual attempt at reverting that endeavor with a more rock sounding album. The more I listened to \"Shack\", the more my faith grew for what was to come. The fact that there was a guitar solo, an excellent bridge and its statement got me excited. Once the teasers came along my expectations grew and grew and I was not let down. I have listened to this album countless times (Which is more than I can say about the critics AKA NME's brutal review that did not even have the facts correct). This album is excellent as it is brave, bold, oldschool and still full of classic Weezer hooks. It is always a great sign when you find yourself unable to pick a favorite. I keep coming back to the Futurescope trilogy knowing in my head that if this song was only ever found in the vast dungeon of Weezer demos(Album five etc) there would be so many of us begging to see it on an album and that is where this album is brave and it gets the highest score for me because of this. Many bands fall into their own comfort zone and fail to evolve. This album is an encapsulation of past, present and future all in one. My album of the year and I've listened to many including some of the higher\/est rated ones here on Metacritic.

Everything's alright in the end.","354":"This album really brings everything Weezer is into one album. The band has brought a lot of emotion back into the lyrics of the songs on the album.

By the time they\u2019re through the blazing guitar solo and drum fills, the original hook is back, only this time it\u2019s slightly slowed down in its full on anthemic glory. THIS is the kind of song Weezer fans have been looking for, and the rest of the album doesn\u2019t disappoint either.\r Songs like Eulogy For a Rock Band and Lonely Girl have a hard edge to go along with the kind of heartfelt melodies that Weezer is known for. I even think I hear Rivers channeling Kurt Cobain a bit near the end of Lonely Girl, as he pleads \u201cI know you\u2019re scared\/I know you\u2019re sad\/I\u2019m here to help you realize it\u2019s not so bad.\u201d If \u201cI\u2019ve Had It Up To Here\u201d is Weezer declaring they\u2019re going to do things their way without letting outside influences cause them to stagnate, \u201cThe British Are Coming\u201d is Weezer immediately making good on that promise. I\u2019m almost positive that if you asked the average fan last year what they\u2019d most like to hear on a new Weezer record, exactly zero of them would\u2019ve said, \u201cI want a Revolutionary War themed anthem with an uplifting guitar solo that ranks among the best they\u2019ve ever recorded.\u201d Sometimes Weezer just knows best.\r Listening to the album from front to back, I get the sense that Weezer intended for this album to be a non-chronological timeline of the many phases Rivers and\/or the band has gone through emotionally throughout the years (and even looks back a couple hundred years to relate to their recent\/current yearning to be free of their oppressors). With \u201cCleopatra\u201d and the cathartic finale of \u201cFoolish Father\u201d in the later portion of the album, one might infer that Rivers has gotten over and\/or accepted demons that have recurred throughout the Weezer catalog, and we\u2019re lucky to have these songs as the expression of that.  The Futurescope Trilogy, with its energetic shredding and heart pounding drum fills, makes me hope that Weezer takes a page out of Hollywood\u2019s book and goes for the Prequel Trilogy next time around. No matter what happens \u201cin the end\u201d, Weezer has crafted not only one of the best albums of 2014, but also one of the best in their entire discography.\u2026 Expand","359":"Weezer has returned to form.

I've even read where the band itself hasn't liked where all of the additional outside influences have led the band.

When I heard that Geffen and Weezer parted ways last year, I was disappointed as it indicated the end of one of the last traditional edgy rock bands and their support by a major label.  However, I've enjoyed where some bands have gone since becoming New Wave Indy in the era of the Internet, so I was heavily anticipating Hurley as their first post-Geffen CD.  While I absolutely despised the opening track and first single, \"Memories,\" the rest of Hurley was a surprisingly well-produced and pop\/rock-driven sound I'm used to from Weezer.  That was very apparent with the intense snare drum intro on \"Ruling Me,\" which smacks of the hard edge on Maladroit, which is the closest to completely independent Weezer got during the Geffen years.Forgettable songs like \"Trainwrecks,\" \"co-written (surprisingly) with 80's hit maker Desmond Child, lose their way.The strings and flutes supporting \"Unspoken\" is a new sound I absolutely love, especially when it kicks in during the final minute of the song.  It's one of the best songs they've recorded in years.Rivers vocals vibrate into a weird Johnny Rotten state on \"Where's My Sex,\" but it works in a very punk way.  One of my favorite current songwriters, Ryan Adams, co-writes \"Run Away\" with Rivers and, while different for current Weezer, channels the old stuff and completely satisfies.  Same with \"Hang On,\" co-written with Rick Nowells, whom I've loved since his days of writing with Stevie Nicks.  And as if Weezer wasn't beach rock enough, they worked with Orange County's finest bass player, No Doubt's Tony Kanal and American Idol writer Jimmy Harry on the raucous \"Smart Girls.\"While thoroughly enjoying Hurley, I was surprised at the rawness of \"Brave New World.\"  I liked it, while not entirely enjoying the chorus.  What surprised me the most is that it was co-written with Linda Perry, who I personally consider to be one of the worst songwriters of the last 20 years.  I have to admit, though, I was impressed with her contribution to the song.The biggest surprise came at the end, though.  Mac Davis.  Yes...the country singer\/songwriter from the 1970s and 80s...co-wrote the closer, \"Time Flies.\"  It's cute, but should have been left as a B-Side.  I was more than thrilled to hear such a fine collection of Weezer material without the support of DGC that it gives me hope for the future.  I'm not sure I want to continue seeing so many collaborations on a single album, but I'm not complaining at the result.  For those who got the deluxe edition, it was adorable hearing them do a very strange version of \"All My Friends are Insects.\"  Same goes with the live inclusion of \"Viva La Vida.\"  \"I Want to be Something\" is a very well-written song that may end up as more than the acoustic version here later on.  However, my favorite bonus track was \"Represent\" released as an anthem for the pursuit of the World Cup earlier in 2010.\u2026 Expand","476":"Much better than Raditude, but still has nothing on the first 4 albums. not entirely forgettable though and a handful of stand-out tracks make this a must have for any hardcore weezer fans.","477":"Hurley has some great tracks on it.

The lyrics on this and the last few albums sound like mediocre middle school poetry. There are also multiple musical\/stylistic faults I found with this album. For instance, the guitar solo starting around the 2-minute mark of In the Mall sounds so similar to the guitar solo of Rush's Tom Sawyer. Search it up. It's ridiculous. (Not to mention the track also has an obnoxiously loud main riff that doesn't remind me of going to the mall ever.) Also, noting that one track, Love Is the Answer is a 'Hindi Version' of a song on Spotify could not be more offensive, and I'm not even Hindi. The last thing this album needed was a racial song title.

The verse in \"Everybody Get Dangerous\" is Cuomo's best stab at anything hip-hop since the vocals of \"El Scorcho.\" \"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived\" starts off as a pretty awesome song, but past the first three minutes, it becomes one great big black mark on the whole album. Rivers tried to make his own \"Jesus of Suburbia,\" to a lesser extent, and it falls flat on its face. The jerky turn-arounds left and right in its six minute runtime completely throw (and in my case, turn) the listener off. \"Dreamin',\" while not as extreme, has some very awkward, uncomfortable structural issues (although I won't deny that it's kind of rockin'). \"Thought I Knew\" is a throwaway track and a disappointment for those looking forward to hear what the other members of Weezer are capable of. \"Automatic\" is a little better, but nothing great. I think Cuomo is better off going with the whole control freak thing. \"The Red Album\" is a great improvement over \"Make Believe\" and even a step or two above \"Maladroit.\" If nothing else, it serves as a very interesting record to the band's fanbase. Sadly, instead of the triumphant return we've been hoping for, this is more so the final nail in the coffin---Weezer is never coming back.

It reminds me of why I liked Weezer in the first place when I heard \"Sweater\" for the first time. Like the Blue Album, these songs aren't going to change the world and can't be dissected for any deeper meaning. But they're fun, and Rivers' always has his tongue firmly planted in his cheek.\u2026 Expand","599":"Everyone giving this a low score without any reasoning doesn't know what they're talking about.

The interesting thing with this album is that it's a more \"mature\" collaborative Weezer, with 5 minute songs, and band members alternating instruments and vocals. This is something I've always been curious about. Starting with Make Believe, it seems as if River's has started to loosen the reigns, and I this is the loosest album yet. Yet, Weezer holds up to all their fun pop melodies, power chord rock, with lyrics that at times make you snicker in amusement. Maybe I'm a sucker, or just too much of a hardcore Weezer fan. But I'm pumped on the Red Album. Also, if there's one place that Make Believe specifically fell short, it was with the slower mellow numbers. While the slower songs on the Red Album still are'nt my favorite selections, they do have a life that was absent from the previous CD. I really enjoy the cut loose feel of this album.

The other tracks, \"Cold Dark World,\" \"Thought I Knew,\" and \"Heart Songs\" annoy me, and are forgettable. The lack of guitar solos really annoys me as well, especially since a few of these songs are built so perfectly for them that you can easily tell where they should have gone, such as around 3:20 or so into \"The Angel and the One\" and after the bridge in \"Pork and Beans.\" Guitar solos have been staples of Weezer songs for so long, it's a shame that they excluded them entirely from this album.\u2026 Expand","621":"This album is slightly better than their last two album combined; but it still plays to the masses a little too much.

While I found that there are several problems with Weezer\u2019s Red Album, perhaps the most critical issue of it was its lyrics. Even for Weezer, which always comes with sometimes corny lyrics, the words to many of the songs on here were just too weird. As for the music, while a few songs certainly did not disappoint with the \u201cclassic Weezer\u201d sound, it got on my nerves that there were so many acoustic songs right in a row at the end. I guess I shouldn\u2019t look too much into that specifically since those songs make up the deluxe version. That being said, Weezer really did like to use the acoustic guitar as a starting instrument, which got repetitive over time. The synths also could feel a little intrusive at times.\r Thanks to the character limit, I am unable to provide my song-by-song commentary, which would perhaps give people who don't agree with my rating more understanding as to why I gave this album what I gave it.\r In general, I had a rather mixed experience with this Weezer album. It just felt repetitive and low effort. While there were some good things about it, I found myself frowning at the music more often than I would have liked. The synths were hit-or-miss and the lyrics could also be rather disappointing. There are only a couple songs from this album I would listen to again, and compared to the Green Album I had a not-so-great experience. I will listen to the next Weezer album because I really hope that I will get another good one. That being said, I didn\u2019t completely hate the Red Album, it was just not nearly as good as I would have hoped. In the excitement that the release of Van Weezer made, I was really looking forward to listening to more Weezer, though after this I should probably lower my expectations.

I agreed mainly with the Pitchfork assessment, that this was a weak record, especially by the saviors of power-pop, the spiritual inheritors to mid-'70s Cheap Trick, etc., etc. Recently, however, I began noticing something. Being on the cusp of turning 23, having recently graduated college, and being somewhere in between longing to be back amongst teenage peers and wanting to act like a grown-up, I started reflecting on the music I've loved throughout my life. Since I grew up in the '90s, Weezer was amongst those bands I considered my favorite. Then I started thinking, what has Weezer actually DONE for me? Well, go back to the Blue Album -- it's an album about being a freshman or sophomore in high school; by junior year, however, you've gotten MORE melodramatic, thinking your life is just one big fricking soap opera -- and that's where Pinkerton comes in. By the time you're ready to at least pretend to act like a grown-up, around 18 or 19, you're dating, screwing, drinking, doing drugs, things like that, and that's where the Green Album works. And when you're getting ready to finish up your college career and thinking that the real world's coming soon, so you'd better cherish what little time you have left, Maladroit (which, by the way, means \"awkward,\" a perfect explanation of what it feels like to be about 21), goes down perfectly. Then comes \"Make Believe.\" It's easy to dismiss this as the worst of Weezer's records (which it isn't; that distinction, and screw the Weezophiles who worship at the Japanese-fetish temple, goes to Pinkerton); but this actually cuts deeper once you're in that mode of being just-about-ready to grow up and move on with your life. Take \"We Are All On Drugs,\" for example. Dissed by most as Weezer turning from the slightly ambiguous turn on drug use to an anti-drug anthem, people have missed what it's about: it's about not being a kid anymore but still feeling like you want to party as if you are. This is an album about how much growing up sucked in retrospect, but how absolutely frightening it is to think you might not be able to live a carefree life anymore. The fact that Rivers Cuomo is stuck in a perpetual state of arrested development is unimportant; this album holds up really well, despite the shoddy and glitzy production by Rick Rubin.\u2026 Expand","724":"Considering that most music reviewers are self-pretentious idiots with not a hint of musical knowledge within them (seriously - I bet that the some of these reviews are by journalists not important enough to cover real news), it's not surprising that an album as catchy and well-made as Make Believe is disregarded and even blatantly insulted.

Their early work is nowadays considered as masterpieces, but at the release of 2005's \"Make Believe\" they gained the status of \"foolish\" and their albuns just fallen in a mix of cliche and dumb songs, with singles so commercial that lose their \"power rock magic\" of good melodys and chorus and strong instrumental.  At the end, more than i expected to hear in this album, i really liked it. I don't know if we can call it \"colorful\" or \"thematic\", but Maladroit has something very unique, something precious i would say. It's not a masterpiece, has its downs, like the boring notes of \"American Gigolo\", \"Dope Nose\" with their predictable chords and the uncreative chorus of \"Love Explosion. But, even in those tracks are good things, like the riff of \"American Gigolo\" or the solo in \"Love...\". But we can forget those moments with super highlights that the album has, like \"Slob\", \"Burnt Jamb\" and \"Slave\". \"Slob\" has what i most cherish in Weezer's sound, that is the mix of simple power chords, a certain naivety,  childshness and fun, and under all of that a kind of darkness and total confusion. We note all of this characteristics in \"Slob\", like the dark main riff, the mix of naivety and pain on Cuomos' melody, and the pusher chorus that take us to a world of chaos, but a child chaos, kind of something that it's not very serious or sad, but has a great power to let us feel that it is, actually, something really painful, like a kid that's crying for a really fool thing but thinks its the end of the world. We can enjoy a lot songs like the fresh \"Burnt Jamb\", that seems like a beach song but only if this beach is at Weezer's world, where from nothing a slight song changes into a heavy metal jump and the very good chorus of \"Take Control\", it is an enjoyable record. But, the darkness is living there too, less than in \"Pinkerton\", but something in the weather of \"Death and Destruction\" or \"Take Control\". What got me with suprise was the track \"Death...\", a romantic and delicate song, with a balanced rhythm, a nice sequence of fingering, the strong very kind of Weezer chorus and the cool heavy metal solo. That strange mix of alt rock and pop rock melodies and chords and kind of dark nature, with naivety and heavy metal riffs and solos are elements that make this record pretty original. There is too a very good and funny single, \"Keep Fishin\" and the ironic \"Space Rock\", but what is most closer of a serious sentimental track here is the powerful \"Slave\", one of my favorites Weezer's songs, that, like \"Slob\", has the things that i most like on their music, and besides that, is a very sonic and heavy track, and more, there's something a little shoegazing and dramatic, what's is not so commom on Weezer's atmosphere. Ending, Maladroit is a pretty good album, has some weak things, but has also very powerful things, creative things (besides some foolish but acceptable lyrics) and even deep stuff their. I don't know completely what makes me trhink that besides a very good record it's not a **** great\" album, is that i trhink they could've evolved more and made something more, i don't know, adult, at least this time.

All of the songs are catchy and you can listen to the whole album in just 30 minutes. Not as deep as most Weezer records, I still find myself listening to it if I just want good fun rock.","829":"Solid effort from Weezer... Probably third best album behind The Blue Album and Pinkerton, \"Island in the Sun\" is especially fun live and the songs flow nicely and make for a hell of a listen.","830":"Their most forgivable album, but this where they started to stray. I started listening to them when this record came out. \"Photograph\" and \"Island in the Sun\" are great Weezer songs","831":"Weezer's first 2 albums are absolute classics.

Some of the tunes are too mainstream for my tastes and aren't as exciting on the material on Pinkerton or Blue, but you can't go wrong with Photograph or Island in the Sun.","835":"Definitely not Weezer's best *coughPinkertoncough* but a solid album nonetheless. This is the kind of album that deserves to just be listened to straight through- a task which is, sadly, over in less than half an hour. Short but sweet, carefree power pop at its finest.","836":"The guitar work on the album is different than the first two but is still as great. Don't Let Go, Simple Pages, and Island in the Sun are my highlights of the album.","837":"While the album is more upbeat and fun than it's predecessor, the writing is very bland, uninspired, and rushed.

Rivers was clearly still embarrassed at the time about Pinkerton and so the lyrics here are not very personal or retrospective. But like the music, they are still a lot of fun, all at a digestible 28 minutes.","840":"Yes, there's a certain formula that runs through this album, but it works so well (for the most part). If you look beyond the formula, there's a sense of emotional urgency and a deep desire for life. All of you who dismissed the album need to revisit it, as I really believe this is Weezer's greatest album after the four masterpieces that are the Blue Album, Pinkerton, the White Album and OK Human.","841":"When I first started listening to Weezer, I picked up the Blue Album and listened for hours to the silly, nerdpop blended with heavily distorted 1\/4\/5 riffs that absolutely \"blue\" me away (ha, im sad). I then went to their second LP, Pinkerton, and after a few skeptical listens, I came to love the LP more than their first (personally, but they are both amazing in their own rights).

I found myself crying a few times listening to Pinkerton. When I first listened to this record, I cried. I cried tears of pure sorrow and betrayal, as the life force that kept me going was ripped from me. This is absolute garbage. All emotion is removed. The closest Weezer comes to making me feel like they give a **** on this album is with Island in the Sun. Every other song, whether it be Hash Pipe or any other mind numbingly awful track, is more painful than trying to slit your own eyeball with a shoestring. This isn't even Weezer's worst! Absolutely depressing.\u2026 Expand","842":"I'll have to listen to this again soon because it may say I have given this a nine, but I still really haven't decided between a 9 or 10 yet.\rTHIS ALBUM ROCKS","843":"One of Weezer's most happiest and upbeat albums they released.
