hagkesei t richard watching the plain bagole it's been a crazy week in the world of finance as you've probably heard by now we've seen the collapse of not one but two ues banks over the span of just a couple of days this past week it started on wednesday with silvergate capital corps which is a criptal friendly institution whose stock was already down ninety four per cent over the past six months announced that it would begin its voluntary liquidation to try and meet its liabilities which cause the stock to fall roughly another fifty per cent since it still a publicly trated position and the friday after seeing its own stalk drop sixty per cent on wednesday alone and another sixty six plus per cent in premarket trading on thursday before the stock tradey was halted silicon valley bank a commercial bank that served primarily start ups and tat companies in california was shut down by the f d i c the federal deposit in surance corporation and while the false silver bank is itself problematic i can't emphasize enough how much bigger of a story as ph b is because of just how much bigger of a bank it was at the end of twenty twenty two silvergate had six point three billion dollars in deposits compared to silicon valley bank which had over one hundred and seventy billion or twenty seven times what silver gate had in roughly seventeen times the amount of customer funds that were misappropriated by f t x in fact esph b is the largest bank to collapse since the two thousand eight financial crisis it is the second largest bank collapse in u s history a so clearly a meaningful story and what's rearlly crazy here is that this isn't the result of some bad loans or a stupid investment in a cryptol curency project that when sour it all seems to be because of a bank run where customers withdraw more money than the bank has on hand since it uses customer deposits to lend out loans and can't immediately recall that money something that many consider to be an old problem and that we haven't really seen to this scale since again the two thousand eight financial crisis now as with any story that involves a collapse of a company bank or otherwise i do want to provide a more well rounded perspective on the situation there's lot of people a ringing the alarms an end in a warning that this is the next big financial crisis i think there's a lot of new aunts to the situation that's worth high lighting things could a all very quickly and obviously this is a developing story ah but you know it is very very incredibly early to make such a drass a call like that ah but there are problems here that are worth addressing and i wanta folk is primarily on sp b since it is a much larger bank and patrockboy ricently put out o vidio explaining the silvergate situation in more detail than i'll likely go in with his fidio hit's o highly recommend that one i'l leave a lincoln the description if he want to learn more about that situation but the two cover the scene problem the two stories are both kind of about the same thing to an extent ah so you cannot may as well explain the silvergate situation to explain what happened with s p b so be sumarising that situation and in the focussing on what the ramifications of s p b is for the economy so silver gate as you might have heard by now is in otherwise conventional financial institution that helped provide services for cryptolcompanies cryptol currency exchanges and services a lot of their clints were crippdo currency focus which was a really good nieche for them prior to twenty twenty two but with the claps of f t x and all the fraud that's surrounding the situation with san bank ment freed it's led to a run on crepta currency exchanges which has translated into a run on this financial institution's assets and in the last three months of twenty twenty two alone silvergate customers withdrew eight billion dollars of their cryptal length deposits which represented roughly two thirds of the crupo curency deposits  because thespank didn't have the full eight billion dollars on hand they had to sell five point two billion dollars worth of their assets to meet this demand which translated into a loss of seven hundred eighteen million dollars and to put how much money they lost into perspective if he took all the money that the bank made in profits from twenty sixteen up to the third quarter of twenty twenty two it wouldn't even cover a quarter of the money lost in cue four of twenty twenty two alone so ya they lost a lot of money as for why this loss was so big as you might know banks hold a lot of their money in treasury bonds a including customer deposits which is seen as a relatively safe and liquid investment it doesn't earn you a crazy return but you know theres confidence in the west government and it's very easy to sell to get your money back out of these instruments but the problem is that a law these bonds were acquired when interest rates were near rock bottom over the past decade when the federal funsrate was near zero and as you might be aware of fundamental relationship in bonds is that their price is inversely related to interestraits so when intrestrats were low these bonds were purchased up here and now that rates have had their very aggressive move higher prices for these bonds on the market have decreased quite dramatically now bonds are still typically a safer investment because you could technically just wait for them to mature to get the face value of the bon back so yeu woult necessarily realized such a drastic loss but the problem is at this bank with these large customer withdrawals had to meet these cash needs immediately with the firesale of these bonds on to the open market at this depressed price at basically the worst time to do so in fact bink even had to take bonds a had plann to hold intil maturity that were classified as such on their balance sheet and had to sell those ones as well which even widened to the loss further and all led to two weeks ago the company announcing that it wasn't sure if it would be a going concern business and this past wednesday the company announcing a voluntary liquidation of its assets that would be closing down selling everything to try and neat all its liabilities now this not the end of the drama here the company is still being investigated by the department of justice forits connections with f t x and sam bigman fried owere llegedly be customers at the bank with over one billion dollars of assets with them and on the same day as this announced liquidation we started to see the crumbling of silicone valley bank which as mentioned is a much bigger deal now silicon valley bank is actully just one of four businesses owned by the holding company which is s  b financial the publicly traded stock albe it it is the largest segmen by far it makes up roughly ninety per cent of their pretax ernings as of twenty twenty one and as a name probably implies they primarily serve ace start ups antechnology firms ah which have been under pressure in the current high rate environment and economic outlook because in addition to all this bond stuff rising rates to also make capital harder to axis for venture capitalisten an start up so it's not a very a ideal environment for someone who's try to start a business i now we talk numbers but again to put this bank size into perspective according to their own filings they bank nearly half of us venture backd teck in life sciences companies in the united states so they are a big player in the venture capital space and really at a high level the situation is very similar to what happened a silver gate it started again on the wednesday when es we reannounced that because of large customer withdrawals it had lost one point eight billion dollars related to the firesale of assets to again meet those cash withdrawals something that allegibly stemmed from the company facing a potential credit downgrade from moodies which also prompted the company to look into selling two point two five billiong dollars in new shares and prefer shares to bolster its cash balance and restore confidence in its operations but rather than comming the markets this trigger to panic in the venture capital space and caused many venture capital companies to advise their clients their start up clients to withdraw their money from the bank and withdraw they did because in a single day the company saw forty two billion dollars worth of withdrawals roughly a quarter of their customer deposits gone in a single day at this point the company had failed to raise capital had had its stock halted as it tried to find to buyer for its business and on friday regulators closed down the bank which leads us with the question of what now you might have heard before that banks do not go bankrupt and that is true and that applies in the situation so where d we go from here well a crine silvergates onliquidation plan because again they are still within control of their assets unlike as we b they plan to pay back everyone's deposits and meet all their obligations a time will tell if that's possible and if they hade the means to do so but being peremptive in doing thi sliquidation does certainly help with that as opposed to waiting for the last second and as mentioned with s v b they've now been taken over by the ft i c as a receiver meaning that they'll be selling all the asets to try and meat depositors and creditors liabilities awith the money being returned to depositrs as a divid and buthat'll be paid over time as the money's received and there is also some protection here for ft i se insure deposits with the acticy indicating that depositor should have access to their insured funds no later than monday morning which is a awesome turn around but as great as that sounds the problem is that ninety five point five per cent of the bank's deposits are not covered by this f t i c insurance for a couple of reasons the first is that some of these deposits are foreign deposits which are not covered by f t i c and the second reason is that the ft i see only covers commercial accounts up to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ind given that these are silicon valley ventures many of them have a lot more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars to run their corporation so that means that the vast majority of deposits are not protected by this traditional safety net and that basicly means the efte isee we'll just have to do the best it can with the acits that the bank has to raise the money needed to cover these liabilities which obviously does not give depositors who are stuck with this pank a whole lot of confidence but obviously the biggest concern here its more so about the follow write the contagion effect here and how this will impact other parts of the uus financial system past week saw a broadsail off in the us financial sector a big banks like japy morgan and bank of america saw their socks do cline quite a bit in other reginal banks even saw their trading activity halted we had first republic bank western allines bank corp pack west bank corp and perhaps most notably signature bank which was another bank that catred primarily to cryptocurrenzy clients ah with one hundred a d fourteen billion dollars in asets relative to silver gates eleven billion dollars and with how difficult it is to really quantify the risk involved with the collapse of a financial institution within the largest econom in the world it has left a lot of people wondering if this is the next financial crisis in the united states abut again to that point i do ont to offer some points to consider not to tell you that somethings goin happen this way or that way but just to provide better perspective for one an importan thing to keep mind here will it is obviously going to be detrimental to the cash floes of venture firms and you know just their funancial situation as a whole depositors are likely to get some of their money back with some believing that there is a chance depositors are made whole a same can't be said for investors probably very low on the priority lists here but based again on what we can see there are ocits that should help cover these deposits as of the end of tpweinty twenty two the company had two hundred and twelve billion dollars in assets of which roughly one hundred thirty one point four billion was in cash in government fixed income securities which taken at face value would represent seventy five point nine per cent of deposits albe it there is likely to see some write down with the treasuries there and the company is owed seventy three point six billion dollars in loans so that's money that the company should eventually receive and that the ft icy should be able to eventually pay out two depositors and creditors and assuming that the loans are as high quality as the bank claimed before being taken over that should help with the situation another point to keep mind here as that again compared to criptocorrency collapse is that we saw of this past year a this situation has the full attention of regulators and even other financial institutions its in those parties best interest to maintain faith in the u s financial system so there obvicy incentivies to see this resolved in a sound way and finally the biggest point to keep mind is that the scope of the situation is currently pretty limited i understand  there is a risk of contagion and that's kind of the biggest fer people have is that this will lead to other types of bank runs but this does seem to be relatively idiostocratic situation as has been hilated by some other analysts these are reginal commercial banks meaning that they operate in a specific area they are a nation wide operation and they cate or two companies not individual households or or retail bankers some likely that would see a situation like this play out with one of the bigger banks like bank of america or jpy morgan a jpy morgan has twopon three trillion dollars in deposits and has a much more diversfied clint base that again isn't as exposed to the specific industry risks that were faced by these other two banks a given the collapse of cryptal currencies and th harsh environments that venture capitalis currently operating within still with all this there will likely be followed of some sort we've aready seen to sell off in the crypto currency space tied to silver gate the u s t c stable coin has since lost its peg to the stoller as it's been revealed that it had exposure to the silikon valley bank and for anyone in the space of venture backed tec companies this is a devastating event right some people might never recover from this i get that with over quarter million dollars of money deposited these companies might not be getting in all that much sympathy by the end of the day these are firms that contribute to the american economy that have had their oxess to cash completely hampered because of what's transpired over just a couple of days and therewill likely be things that we can't predict to day that will happen down the road because of what's happened this past week bocurrently again my point here is to provide a more rounded perspective to a kindo god peuple way from the headlines about the next financial crisis because this is nowhere near the scale of the tuthazena financial crisis and is not merely the same a fundamental issues at hand and when it comes to leverage into rivatives this is tied to a bank run and concentration risk primarily that also caused issues because of rising introstraits ah it's not nearly the same level of saint negligence you could argue that concentration risk was poorly managed and ino building a bank off of a val tawel ripple crinsy industry silvergateas may be less defensible ah but none the less it's a very fundamentally different situation and this isn't theftii ses first rodio they actually just dealt with the bank collapse in twenty twenty i'll be it a much much smaller situation there but this is what they were made for and the vast majority of retail bankers do have that f d i c insurance to cover the vast majority of the deposits they have if not all of them so long as they do bank with an f d i c insured institution still in terms of how far reaching the impact here will eventually be we will have to see how things play out sasof idyo another kind of light on frills piece to get it oul quickly and talk about something that really has been very crazy and very fast in the financial markets and trying to counteract some of the titles tha you'l likely see ar on the situation and pull people back from the edge a little bit ah so i hope youe
