yes richard wasn't playing that role it's been a crazy week in the world of finance as you probably heard by now we've seen the collapse of not wine by two u. s. banks over the span of just a couple of days this past week get started on wednesday with silver gate apple core which is a cripple friendly institution whose stock was already down ninety four percent over the past it's minds not set to begin it's gone three liquidation to try and meet its liabilities which causes softball roslin other fifty percent since it's still a publicly traded position and on friday after seen its own stock dropped sixty percent on wednesday along and another sixty six plus percent in pre market trading on thursday before the sock tree was halted silicon valley bank a commercial bank that's her primarily to start ups and tech companies in california was shot down by the f. d. i. c. the federal deposit insurance corporation them all false or bank is itself problematic and i emphasize enough how much bigger story as phoebe is because of just how much bigger of the pink it was at the end of which way to so great at six point three billion dollars in deposits compared to silicon valley day which had over one hundred and seventy billion or twenty seven times what's over dave had been roughly seventeen times enough customer finds that work is appropriated by f. t. x. in fact as phoebe is the largest bencsik lot since the two thousand a financial crisis in is the second largest bank lots in us history by so clearly a meaningful story it was really crazy here is that this isn't the result of some bad loans or a stupid investment in a cripple currency project that went sour dossiers be because of the bank run for customers withdraw more money than the bank has on hands and say you discuss her deposits to live so long think it immediately recall that money something that many consider to be an old problem and that we haven't really seen this scale since again that two thousand a financial crisis not to any story than all the clots of the company ink or otherwise i do wanna provide a more well rounded perspective on the situation is lock people are ringing the alarm zen and no warning that this is the next big financial places i think there's a lot of new wants the situation that's worth violating king's screwball very quickly in all this in this developing story bob i know is very very incredibly early to make such a drastic fall like that although there are problems you'd better with dressing and i wanna hold an early on as the bees since it is a much larger bank and after four hours' sleep under the new explaining this over a situation in more detail than all like to go on with his video as an irishman now wanna leave that link in the description of one or more of that situation but the two car the same problem with two stories are both kind of vote the same thing to an extent on so you had made wallets wins over a situation to explain what happened with asked the beats all weep summarizing that situation and i'm focusing on what the ramifications about as phoebe is for the economy the silver gate as a matter for by now is an otherwise conventional financial institution of that helps provide services for crypto companies cripple currency exchanges and services a lot of their clients were pretty pretty focus which was really good nice for them prior to twenty twenty two for the clock that t. x. and all the frog that's running the situation with sandy and fried it's latour run on perpetrates exchanges which is translated into rhyme on this funny transfusions assets and analyze three months of twinkling to all long silvery customers withdrew a billion dollars of their crippling deposits which represent roughly two thirds of the crypt crazy because it's because they didn't have the full eight billion dollars on hand to have to sell five point two billion dollars worth of your assets to me this command which translated into a loss of seven hundred and eighteen million dollars and put how much when they lost new perspective to be took all the money that the bank made in profits from twenty sixteen pop to the third quarter of twenty twenty two one even current quarter of the money lost in q. four point one eats you along so yeah babe los along money as for why this office so big as my no baseball the launder money in treasury bonds i'm quoting customer deposits which is seen as a relatively safe and liquid investment a dozen are you crazy return but we'll lose confidence in the u. s. government and it's very easy to sell to get your money back out of these instruments the problem is that a lot longer required when interest rates for your rock bottom over the past decade when the federal funds rate was nearer zero and as you might be aware fund relationship in bonds is that their place is inversely related to interest rates so when interest rates will sponsor purchase up here or another rates of fact there are very aggressive move higher prices for these bonds in the market had decreased quite dramatically nobody's ultimately easy for investment because you quit technically just wait for them to make church to get that these value of the bond baxley one answer we realize that a drastic loss but the problem is that the state with these large customer withdrawals had to meet these cash needs in the lead with a fire sale of these bonds on to the open market got this depressed prays that basically the worst time to do so and i think it it's a concept final in some maturity that worked classified as such an on c. and had the cells on the zoology even wind into the loss further than auletta two weeks ago the company announcing that wasn't sure if they would be a going concern business and this past wednesday the company announcing of volunteering liquidation of its assets and of the closing down selling everything to try me all those liabilities that sob in the drama here the county is so being investigated by the department of justice for its connections with that t. x. and senate and free were allegedly because her septic tank with over one billion dollars of assets with them in on the same day as this announcement with asian we started to see the crumbling of silicon valley bay which as mentioned is a much bigger deal now silicon valley bank is actually just one of four businesses owned by the holding company which is as phoebe financial up the traded stock i'll hit is the largest segment by foreign makes up roughly ninety percent of their pre tax earnings other point one one as name probably implies the premier li service start ups and technology firms out which have been under pressure in the current firing in garments and economic they'll lock on it says in addition to all this on soft rising rates to also make out all her taxes for buttercup listen and start up so is not a very ideal in farming for some news reasserted business and only talk numbers by the end of this bank sized perspective according to your own filings the date nearly half of the u. s. venture backed tack in life sciences companies the united states so they are a big player in the venture capital space they really have a high level the situation is very similar to what happens over gave it started again on wednesday with one of the in outset as a large as first ralston lost one point eight billion dollars related to the fire sale of assets to again meet those cash withdrawals from immaculately sam from the company facing a potential credit downgrades from movies which also prompted the company to look into selling two point two five billion dollars in new shares and preferred shares to bolster its cast ballots and restore confidence in its operations so rather than calming the markets this triggered a panic in the venture capital space because they need venture capital money is to be advised their clients there start up clients to withdraw their money from the bank and to withdraw they did because in a single day to calm the south or eighty two billion dollars worth of withdrawals broccoli elkhorn earth other customer deposits gone in a single day at this point the company had failed to raise capital at its stock halted as it tried to find a buyer for its business done on friday it regulators closed down the bay which leaves us with the question about what now he might've heard before that banks do not go bankrupt and that is true and that applies in this situation so where do we go from here will look for is over is all migration plan because again they are still with the control of their assets on might as the b. b. plan to pay back ever once deposits and meet all their obligations that time will tell if that's possible unless they have the means to do so by being pre empted into this liquidation does really help with as opposed to wade into law second and as messing with s. b. b. they've not been taken over by the air tac has a receiver minuet they'll be selling all the assets to try needs depositors and creditors liabilities are with the money being returned to depositors as a dividend by about eighty over time as monies received there is also some protection here for accuracy insured deposits that the air tac indicating that the pazner should have access to their church finds no later than monday morning which is a awesome turner and white as present sounds the problem is that ninety five point five percent of the bank's deposits are not covered by this that the icy insurance up for a couple of reasons the verses that some of these deposits are for deposits which are not covered by fbi see in the second reason is that the f. d. i. c. all the converse commercial towns up to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in given that these are silicone valley benchers many of them have a lot more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars to run the corporation so that means that the vast array of deposits are not protected by this traditional safety net and that is an immediate jesse will just have to do the best it can with the acids that the bank has to raise the money needed to cover these liabilities of which obviously does not give depositors who works out of the spanked awful lot confidence that all is the biggest concern here is more so to follow rate the contagion effect here and how this will impact other parts of the u. s. financial system has big soft rock salt in the u. s. financial sector five dating thirty p. morgan bank america father socks declined put it another refill base even saw gertrude inactivity halted waiver for public a western alliance bancorp pack west bancorp and perhaps most notably signature bank which was another make figured primarily to curb the currency clients are with one hundred forty million dollars in assets relative to silver gates eleven billion dollars in with how difficult it is really quantify the risk involved with the clots of a financial institution within the largest economy in the world it has a lot of people wondering if this is the next five to creases in the united states but again to that point i do offer some points to consider not to tell you that some things can happen this way or that way but just to provide better perspective for one importing in mind here was a busy boy to be detrimental to the cash flows adventurer firm's clients cannot just their financial situation as a whole depositors are likely get some of their money back with some bleeding that there is chance depositors are made whole scene babysit for investors who probably very low on the priority list here but basic animal we can see there are asked sectional cover these deposits as the image which way to becoming a two hundred and twelve billion dollars in assets of which roughly one hundred thirty one point four billion was in cash in government fixed income securities which to of these value would work within seventy five point nine percent of deposits albeit there is likely to see some break down with the treasury's there and tell me is old seventy three point six billion dollars in loans so that's money that the company should eventually receive them at the air tac should be able to eventually pay out to depositors and creditors and assuming that the lawns are as high quality as the bank claims before being taken over that should help the situation of what he might hear is that again compared to curb currency clots that we saw this past year at this situation has the full attention all regulators and even other financials to shuns it's been both parties best interest to maintain peace in the u. s. financial system so there are things and devices see this resolved in a sound way and i did would you mind is that the scope of this situation is currently a pretty limited i understand that there is risk of confusion that's candidate is your people how to set this week other kids bank runs by this does seem to be a role to leave idiosyncratic situation as has been highlighted by some other analysts is a region all commercial banks me that they operate in a specific area american nationwide operation and they cater to companies not individual householder retell the anchors tom likely that would see a situation of this play was on the bigger banks like bank of america or j. p. morgan idea to morgan has two point three trillion dollars in deposits as much more diversified client base that again isn't as exposed to the specific industry risks that were faced by a desire to banks i've given the clouds of purple currencies and harsh environments that venture capital spring operating within so what all this there will likely be full of love songs for reversing this often occur the currency space tied to silver gave us the c. scale coin has since lost its paid to the u. s. dollar as it's been revealed that it had exposure to the silicon valley bank and for anyone in the space of bencher that's tech companies this is a devastating effect break some people might never recover from this i get out over a quarter million dollars of money deposited these companies might not be gain all that much sympathy by the end of the babies are for a second journey to the american economy that have their access to cash completely hampered because of what's transpired over despicable days no likely be things that can create today that will happen down the road because of what's happened this past week other currently again my point you're used to provide a more rounded perspective to open a guy people away from the headlines belt an exponential grace's because this is nowhere near the scale of the two dozen even to grace's high and it is not nearly the same path on mental issues at hand when it comes leverage in derivatives this is tied to a friend in concentration risk primarily that also cause issues because of rising interest rates i've sought nearly the same level of c. negligence you could argue that concentrate risk was poorly managed and you know bill in a bank off of cobalt property currency industry silver it is maybe less offensive all about but nonetheless is a very pointedly different situation than this isn't it yes he's first rodeo they actually just go with the pink lots in twenty twenty albeit a much much smaller situation there is what they were made for in the vast majority of retail bankers to have that accuracy insurance to cover the vast majority of the deposits at that not all of them so long as they do bank with an f. d. i. c. insured institution so in terms of how far reaching the impact here will eventually be we will not see how things play out so as a video another satellite on frills peace to develop quickly and talk was something that really has been very crazy in very fast in the financial markets and trying to counteract some of the titles they like this you're on the situation and pull people back from the edge of the local but i so i hope you found the information useful be that these michelin subscribe politics of this hotel tremendously an anointed thoughts on this down low they threw grenades a hands as always be safe up there
