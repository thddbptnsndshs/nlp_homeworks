The horse raced past the barn fell.
The old man the boat.
The florist sent the flowers was pleased.
The cotton clothing is made of grows in Mississippi.
The sour drink from the ocean.
Have the students who failed the exam take the supplementary.
We painted the wall with cracks.
The man who hunts ducks out on weekends.
The raft floated down the river sank.
When Fred eats food gets thrown.
Mary gave the child the dog bit a Band-Aid.
The girl told the story cried.
I convinced her children are noisy.
Helen is expecting tomorrow to be a bad day.
Fat people eat accumulates.
I know the words to that song about the queen donâ€™t rhyme.
She told me a little white lie will come back to haunt me.
The dog that I had really loved bones.
That Jill is never here hurts.
The man who whistles tunes pianos.
The man pushed through the door fell.
I told the girl the cat scratched Bill would help her.
The old dog the footsteps of the young.
Because he always jogs a mile seems a short distance to him.
The florist sent the bouquet of flowers was very flattered.
The complex houses married and single soldiers and their families.
Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana.
